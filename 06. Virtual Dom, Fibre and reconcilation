React Fibre:

The goal of React Fiber is to increase its suitability for areas like animation, layout and gestures. its headline
feature is incremental rendering: the ability to split rendering work into chunks and spread it out over multiple frames.

- pause work and come back to it later
- assign priority to different types of work
- reuse previously completed work
- abort work if it's no longer needed

The algorithm React uses to diff one tree with another to determine which parts need to be changed.
